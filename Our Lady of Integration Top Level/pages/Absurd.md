- The product of a process where [[Meaning]] is found in meaninglessness.
- The absurd is primarily an experience that occurs when the distance between one's worldview of meaning and other worldviews or contradictory evidence is made manifest. Finding meaning where another meaning or no meaning was intended is the common experience discussed in works such as Albert Camus's, The Myth of Sisyphus. Additionally, the colloquial use of the term focuses on the experience of finding no meaning where meaning would typically be found, such as linguistic utterances and art, whether that lack of meaning was intentional or not.
- In [[Our Lady of Integration]], the absurd is primarily used as the quality of finding and creating meaning, given that meaning derived from an [[Icon]], [[Story]], [[Symbol]], event, etc. may be diverse among the individuals who experience it.
